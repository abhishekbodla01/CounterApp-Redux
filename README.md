# React-Redux Counter Application

A simple and interactive counter application built with React and Redux. This project demonstrates state management using Redux, along with React hooks such as `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and `useState`. Users can increment, decrement, or reset the counter value, and specify custom increment values through an input field.

## Features
- **Increment/Decrement**: Adjust the counter value by 1.
- **Reset**: Set the counter back to zero.
- **Custom Increment**: Input a specific number to increment the counter by a desired value.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **React Hooks**: Including `useSelector`, `useDispatch`, and `useState` for managing component state and side effects.
